# OpenTenBase Database Management System
OpenTenBase is an advanced enterprise-level database management system based on prior work of Postgres-XL project. It supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including transactions, foreign keys, user-defined types and functions. Additionally, it adds parallel computing, security, management, audit and other functions.

OpenTenBase has many language interfaces similar to PostgreSQL, many of which are listed here:

	https://www.postgresql.org/download

## Overview
A OpenTenBase cluster consists of multiple CoordinateNodes, DataNodes, and GTM nodes. All user data resides in the DataNode, the CoordinateNode contains only metadata, the GTM for global transaction management. The CoordinateNodes and DataNodes share the same schema.

Users always connect to the CoordinateNodes, which divides up the query into fragments that are executed in the DataNodes, and collects the results.

The latest version of this software may be obtained at:

visudo 
# Then uncomment the line "% wheel", save and exit
```

### Building

```bash
su - opentenbase
cd /data/opentenbase/
git clone https://github.com/OpenTenBase/OpenTenBase

export SOURCECODE_PATH=/data/opentenbase/OpenTenBase
export INSTALL_PATH=/data/opentenbase/install/

cd ${SOURCECODE_PATH}
rm -rf ${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v5.0
chmod +x configure*
./configure --prefix=${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v5.0 --enable-user-switch --with-libxml --with-openssl --with-ossp-uuid CFLAGS="-g"
# 如果遇到 configure: error: zstd library not found.报错或者 configure: error: lz4 library not found. 报错，可以到这里寻找答案 https://github.com/OpenTenBase/OpenTenBase/issues/166
make clean
make -sj
make install
chmod +x contrib/pgxc_ctl/make_signature
cd contrib
make -sj
make install
```

**Notice: if you use Ubuntu and see *initgtm: command not found* while doing "init all", you may add *${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v5.0/bin* to */etc/environment***

## Installation
Use PGXC\_CTL tool to build a cluster, for example: a cluster with a global transaction management node (GTM), a coordinator(COORDINATOR) and two data nodes (DATANODE).
<img src="images/topology.png" width="50%" />
### Preparation

* 1. Install pgxc and import the path of pgxc installation package into environment variable.

```shell
PG_HOME=${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v5.0
export PATH="$PATH:$PG_HOME/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PG_HOME/lib"
export LC_ALL=C
```

* 2. Disable SELinux and firewall (optional)

```
vi /etc/selinux/config # set SELINUX=disabled
# Disable firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl stop firewalld
```

* 3. Create the *. tar.gz package for initializing instances.

```
cd /data/opentenbase/install/
tar -zcf opentenbase-5.21.8-i.x86_64.tar.gz *
```

### Cluster startup steps

1. Generate and fill in configuration file opentenbase\_config.ini . pgxc\_ctl tool can generate a template for the configuration file. You need to fill in the cluster node information in the template. After the pgxc\_ctl tool is started, pgxc\_ctl directory will be generated in the current user's home directory. After entering " prepare config" command, the configuration file template that can be directly modified will be generated in pgxc\_ctl directory.

* Description of each field in opentenbase\_config.ini
```
| Configuration Category | Configuration Item | Description                                                                |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| instance               | name              | Instance name, available characters: letters, numbers, underscores, e.g.: opentenbase_instance01 |
|                        | type              | distributed represents distributed mode, requires gtm, coordinator and data nodes; centralized represents centralized mode |
|                        | package           | Software package. Full path (recommended) or relative path to opentenbase_ctl |
| gtm                    | master            | Master node, only one IP                                                   |
|                        | slave             | Slave nodes. If n slave nodes are needed, configure n IPs here, separated by commas |
| coordinators           | master            | Master node IPs, automatically generate node names, deploy nodes-per-server nodes on each IP |
|                        | slave             | Slave node IPs, the number is an integer multiple of master               |
|                        |                   | Example: If 1 master 1 slave, the number of IPs is the same as master; if 1 master 2 slaves, the number of IPs is twice that of master |
|                        | nodes-per-server  | Optional, default 1. Number of nodes deployed on each IP. Example: master has 3 IPs, configured as 2, then there will be 6 nodes |
|                        |                   | cn001-cn006 total 6 nodes, 2 nodes distributed on each server            |
| datanodes              | master            | Master node IPs, automatically generate node names, deploy nodes-per-server nodes on each IP |
|                        | slave             | Slave node IPs, the number is an integer multiple of master               |
|                        |                   | Example: If 1 master 1 slave, the number of IPs is the same as master; if 1 master 2 slaves, the number of IPs is twice that of master |
|                        | nodes-per-server  | Optional, default 1. Number of nodes deployed on each IP. Example: master has 3 IPs, configured as 2, then there will be 6 nodes |
|                        |                   | dn001-dn006 total 6 nodes, 2 nodes distributed on each server            |
| server                 | ssh-user          | Username for remote command execution, needs to be created in advance, all servers should have the same account for simpler configuration management |
|                        | ssh-password      | Password for remote command execution, needs to be created in advance, all servers should have the same password for simpler configuration management |
|                        | ssh-port          | SSH port, all servers should be consistent for simpler configuration management |
| log                    | level             | Log level for opentenbase_ctl tool execution (not the log level of opentenbase nodes) |

```

* Create a configuration file opentenbase\_config.ini for the instance
```
mkdir -p ./logs
touch opentenbase_config.ini
vim opentenbase_config.ini
```

* For example, if I have two servers 172.16.16.49 and 172.16.16.131, the typical configuration of a distributed instance distributed across the two servers is as follows. You can copy this configuration information and make modifications according to your deployment requirements.Don't forget to fill in the ssh password configuration.
```
# Instance configuration
[instance]
name=opentenbase01
type=distributed
package=/data/opentenbase/install/opentenbase-5.21.8-i.x86_64.tar.gz

# GTM nodes
[gtm]
master=172.16.16.49
slave=172.16.16.50,172.16.16.131

# Coordinator nodes
[coordinators]
master=172.16.16.49
slave= 172.16.16.131
nodes-per-server=1

# Data nodes
[datanodes]
master=172.16.16.49,172.16.16.131
slave=172.16.16.131,172.16.16.49
nodes-per-server=1

# Login and deployment account
[server]
ssh-user=opentenbase
ssh-password=
ssh-port=36000

# Log configuration
[log]
level=DEBUG
```


* Similarly, the configuration of a typical centralized instance is as follows.Don't forget to fill in the ssh password configuration.
```
# Instance configuration
[instance]
name=opentenbase02
type=centralized
package=/data/opentenbase/install/opentenbase-5.21.8-i.x86_64.tar.gz

# Data nodes
[datanodes]
master=172.16.16.49
slave=172.16.16.131
nodes-per-server=1

# Login and deployment account
[server]
ssh-user=opentenbase
ssh-password=
ssh-port=36000

# Log configuration
[log]
level=DEBUG
```

2. Execute command for instance installation.
* Execute installation command: ./opentenbase_ctl install  -c opentenbase_config.ini
```
